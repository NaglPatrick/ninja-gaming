## Logging Libraries: Why are they used?
Logging libraries are essential in software development for recording and managing log messages. 
They provide a standardized way to capture events, errors, and diagnostic information. 
Logging is crucial for debugging, troubleshooting, performance analysis, and auditing. 
Libraries make it easy to generate log messages that can be written to files, databases, or the console.

## Log Levels in Log4J and their significance
Log4J is a popular Java logging library. 
It offers different log levels: TRACE (detailed debugging), DEBUG (development and testing), INFO (progress/state information), 
WARN (potential issues), ERROR (execution errors), and FATAL (critical errors). 
These levels allow developers to categorize log messages by severity, control verbosity, and filter messages in production environments.

## Configuration Options in Log4J
Log4J provides configuration options to customize logging behavior. 
Key options include: defining log output destinations (files, console, remote), 
specifying log message format, applying log filters based on level or class, configuring loggers and appenders, and enabling runtime configuration changes.

Log4J's configuration capabilities make it a versatile logging library, allowing developers to tailor logging to their application's needs.
