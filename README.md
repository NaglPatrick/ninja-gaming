# Project Title: Calculator
![Calculator](./resources/images/Calculator.png)

This project involves working different methods that can calculate .

## Code
The code for this project is written in Java and uses a variety of methods to accomplish its tasks. These methods include:

+ `double add(double number1, double number2)`
Calculates the sum of `number1` and `number2`. The operation is logged at the DEBUG level.

+ `double minus(double number1, double number2)`
Subtracts `number2` from `number1` and returns the result. The operation is logged at the DEBUG level.

+ `double divide(double number1, double number2)`
Divides `number1` by `number2` and returns the quotient. If `number2` is `zero`, an error is logged at the ERROR level, and an ArithmeticException is thrown.

+ `double multiply(double number1, double number2)`
Multiplies `number1` by `number2` and returns the product. The operation is logged at the DEBUG level.

+ `double faculty(double number)`
Calculates the factorial of `number` recursively. The input is logged at the DEBUG level. If number is less than or equal to zero, the result is 0.

## Installation and run

This is an exercise project which can be started directly from the UDI of your choice.

## Get involved

Since it was an exercise and will be edited further as an exercise, there is no need to help or change the Project.
